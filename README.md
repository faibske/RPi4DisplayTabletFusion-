# RPi4DisplayTabletFusion-
This is a weird device, which is part dekstop, part tablet. It works with a Raspberry Pi 4 B, the official camera V2.1 and the official 7" display

This project is also on Thingiverse:

Summary

This is my little build of a Raspberry Pi 4 B matched with the official 7" display and the official Camera V2.1. It's my second attempt to build a portable Raspberry Pi. The first one was build completely with wood, the felt and the wood on the backside are leftovers from it. I suggest that you build yourself a similar housing for the display, because this is much more secure than using only this 3d-printed case from me. Sorry, but I was simply to lazy to make also a printed back panel for it. You'll get over it!

Some instructions to the thing from me:

    this whole case mounts on the backside of the RPi Display. There should be 3.5mm of space between the holes on the back and the 3d printed case.
    the four bigger holes on the backside of the 3d printed case are for one 50mm fan. (In the end I build a adapter out of wood for one 40mm fan for myself)
    the other holes on the backside of the case are to mount a powerbank, battery, or whatever you want (maybe an adapter for a vesa mount?). I've also cutted a piece of wood to help mounting my battery (which is by the way the official Arduino battery. I secured it with many rubber bands. There is also a cutout on the wooden backside of the display, so I have two charging ports on it - a micro USB and a USB-C).
    There is plenty of room inside the case, if you want you could for example build a speaker inside or put RGB in it, which shines through the fan vents.

Some points to my construction:

    I've used the Raspberry Pi keychain by kikuon:

    I've used several different constructions to testfit everything on my computer:
